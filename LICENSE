ABOUT THIS PROJECT

EvidXMusic is a Python-based Telegram Music Bot designed to provide
high-quality music streaming in Telegram voice chats. It supports
multiple music sources, queue management, playlists, auto-play,
and real-time controls using Pyrogram and PyTgCalls.

This project is intended to remain free and open-source so that users
can study, modify, and improve the software while respecting the
freedoms guaranteed by the GNU General Public License.

                            PREAMBLE

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all
its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.
